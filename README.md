# Whiteboard app

This is a simple whiteboarding app with classic features like drawing, erasing, and clearing the canvas. It is built with React and TypeScript.

## Main features

The main idea behind this project is to recreate a Figma style object and page relationship, but instead of objects being represented as separate layers, they are presented as children of a page. This allows for a more structured approach to whiteboarding, where objects can be grouped together and moved around as a single entity.

Also objects can be moved from one page to another, and pages can be duplicated or deleted.
